## Usage
### Configuration
In your React Application, in the main entry file (typically App.js):

import the ReactDOM and runWax Module

```sh
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import runWax from '@wally-ax/wax-dev-react';

const waxConfig = {
    rules: [],
    apiKey: "YOUR_WALLY_DEVELOPER_API_KEY",
  };
runWax(React, ReactDOM, waxConfig);
```


Hereâ€™s how the setup of your application should be structured, as shown below.

App.js
```javascript
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import runWax from '@wally-ax/wax-dev-react';
import './App.css';
import Form from './Form';

function App() {
  const waxConfig = {
    rules: [],
    apiKey: "API KEY",
  };
  runWax(React, ReactDOM, waxConfig);
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <p>
        Wally Dev React
      </p>
      <Form />

    </div>
  );
}
export default App;

````
rules: An array of strings representing rule definitions. Available rules can be found [here]("https://kb.wallyax.com/docs/wax-dev/rules"). An empty array will include all rules.

apiKey: A string required for the wax-dev-react to work. You can get the api key from [WallyAX Developer Portal](https://developer.wallyax.com)

### Results
The results will be displayed in your browser's Developer console.
