### Contribution Guidelines

## Introduction (for first timers)
Thank you for your interest in contributing to an open-source project! Our world works on people taking initiative to contribute to the "commons" and contributing to open source means you are contributing to make things better for not only yourself but everyone else too! So thank you for taking this initiative.

Great projects also work because of great quality. Open source or not, the user really cares that things should work as they are advertised, and consistently. New features should follow the same pattern and so that users don't have to learn things again and again.

Developers who maintain open source also expect that you follow certain guidelines. These guidelines ensure that developers are able to quickly give feedback on your contribution and how to make it better. Most probably you might have to go back and change a few things, but it will be in the interest of making this process better for everyone. So be prepared for some back and forth.
